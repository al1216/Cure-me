        <h4>What is Plasma Therapy?</h4>
            <p>
            Convalescent plasma therapy uses blood from people whoâ€™ve recovered from an illness to help others recover. Blood donated by recovered COVID-19 patients has antibodies to the virus. The donated blood is processed to remove blood cells, leaving behind liquid (plasma) and antibodies. These can be administered to COVID-19 patients to boost their ability to fight the virus.
        </p>
