•	Donation for oxygen cylinder: if a person/organization can donate oxygen cylinders, then they just have to fill the form and then officials of department contact the required person to collect the oxygen cylinder and further information.

•	Donation for Covid-19: this donation money can be given by anyone and we will make record of each and every donation amount. This donation amount is given to hospitals so that they can purchase oxygen cylinders, beds, medicines, vaccines etc. Furthermore by donation amount we can help poor, homeless people by providing food, shelter, clothes etc.
